<h1 id='payment'>Payment</h1>
<p>In order to make payments towards a user&#39;s bill, they must first link a payment method using the <code>/payment</code> endpoint. By default, after a payment method is linked, payments will be made towards a user&#39;s bills on time. The API allows you to add and retrieve a user&#39;s payment method, as well as make payments towards a bill&#39;s outstanding balance and cancel a scheduled payment.</p>
