<p>Connect is a drop-in module that provides a secure, elegant authentication flow for each company that the Q2 Biller Direct API supports. Connect makes it secure and easy for clients to link their accounts, while doing the heavy lifting for the authentication.</p>

<h3 id='events'>Events</h3>
<p>Connect will emit events back to your app using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">postMessage</a> API or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkscriptmessagehandler">WKScriptMessageHandler</a> on iOS, allowing you to decide what to do after the user is finished.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Event</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>auth</code></td>
<td>The user successfully authenticated with a company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>exit</code></td>
<td>The user exited the module without completing an authentication.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>alive</code></td>
<td>Emitted every 30 seconds to indicate that the user is not idle.</td>

<h3 id='userpresencerequired'>userPresenceRequired</h3>
<p>If the biller requires that the user is present to pass through any <a href="#auth-mfa">MFA</a> flows with every login,
as indicated by the <code>company.userPresenceRequired</code> flag, there are a number of constraints to consider when designing your user experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bill data cannot be updated ad-hoc without the user first passing through MFA.</li>
<li>Payments must be completed in real-time (not scheduled) since the user must be present.</li>
<li>Likewise, Swaps must also be completed in real-time with the user present.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of calling the typical API routes, you&#39;ll need to open Connect to perform these actions immediately after a successful authentication. The user won&#39;t need
 to re-enter their username and password, but may need to step through MFA. Using the <code>billId</code>, <code>items</code>, and <code>paymentMethodId</code> URL parameters as 
 documented below, you&#39;ll be able to make payments in real-time, while allowing users the liberty of maintaining their approach to account security.</p>
<h3 id='url-parameters'>URL parameters</h3>
<p>The following URL parameters can be optionally passed into the Connect URL to customize the experience.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>companyId</code></td>
<td>Deeplink to a specific <code>companyId</code>, skipping the search screen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>billId</code></td>
<td>Can be used in conjunction with <code>paymentMethodId</code> to perform a real-time payment when <code>company.userPresenceRequired</code> is <code>true</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>cardPaymentsOnly</code></td>
<td>Limit searches to companies that support card-based payments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>items</code></td>
<td>Indicates the next desired action once an authentication is successful. Set to <code>swap</code> to automatically create a <a href="#swap">Swap</a>. Set to <code>bill</code> to update bill data. Set to <code>payment</code> to make a payment towards the balance..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>paymentMethodId</code></td>
<td>Sets a previously added payment method to be used for a <code>swap</code> or <code>payment</code> once an authentication is successful.</td>
</tr>
