## Getting Started

Our [white-label products](#products) are the fastest way to implement our API's functionality with a design that fits your branding. If you require a more custom integration you may use the following flow.

### User Creation

1. User signs up in your app.
2. Make a request to the `/client` endpoint to retrieve a `clientId` to store in your database for future requests.

### Authentication

1. Make a request to the `/client/create-token` endpoint to retrieve a secure SSO token to link accounts.
2. Link accounts by integrating the [Connect](#connect) product into your application.

### Bills

1. Requests can be made to the `/bill/list/{clientId}` endpoint to retrieve the list of authenticated bills and balance information.
2. Requests can be made to the `/bill/{billId}` endpoint to retrieve details on a specific bill.

### Payments

1. Provide your user with a "link payment" view to choose a payment method.
2. Link this payment method using the `/payment` endpoint.
3. By default, bills will be paid automatically by using the payment method on file.
4. To change this, you must make a request to the `/payment/settings` endpoint to disable recurring payments.
5. When recurring payments are disabled, in order to make an on-demand payment, one must be scheduled via the `/payment/schedule` endpoint.
6. You can cancel a scheduled payment for a bill by using the `/payment/cancel` endpoint.
