An auth `status.type` can be a variety of types. Each type is documented below with a description of the status and a typical use case.

### verified

The user's auth has been verified. No actions are required.

### authenticate

The auth's credentials are no longer valid and need to be reauthenticated using the [Connect](#connect) product.

### hold

An auth's status can be `hold` for several reasons. When an auth is on hold, the response contains a `reason` for the hold that you can present to your users. To fix the hold, the user must perform the action described in the `reason`, which usually requires them to log in to their online account. Once the user has completed the action, make a request to the `/auth/{authId}/fix-hold` endpoint to resume their services.

Additionally, a [code](#auth-hold-codes) is provided for handling the hold programmatically, if required.
